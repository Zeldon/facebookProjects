The length of the text can vary a lot from one sentence to a paragraph.  Can anyone please point me in the direction of high quality relevant useful papers/books and/or to any individual well versed in the topic that I can reach out to? I have done some reading but most refer to summarizing a long form text which has very different characteristics from my data.\n\nJust to share more background context. I have built a professional feedback solution (hoorah.io). So what we have now is lots of feedback about an individual. It is time consuming to have to read through all of them. Of course they are there for reference but I'd like to give a summary of the feedback a person has received thus far as an overview.\n\nUsing LDA (thanks Kai Xin Thia laoshi) I could tell that the feedbacks could be classified into a few categories. Mentorship, proactive, helpful, detailed etc. the challenge with this is that I have to manually tune the number of clusters until I find a good separation ( not very scalable ). If I cannot find a way to intelligently summarize automatically, the next alternative is to classify and generate the summaries based on the classifications detected. But it would not be a very good user experience as the summaries will appear pre-canned quite quickly.""",b'status',b'',b'',,

Problems occur when the table scheama\'s or the database schema changes.\n\nSome commercial tools are available such as:\n\n - https://datproject.org\n - https://quiltdata.com\n\nProblems here are that you may not want your data in public servers (which is a big concern for a lot of companies), and that there doesn\'t seem to be any form of dependency management.

He passed away early Tuesday morning, February 7, 2017, surrounded by his family in Uppsala, Sweden.\n\nEleven years ago, the three of us, Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling & Anna Rosling R\x94nnlund founded Gapminder. In 2007 Hans decided to ?drop out? of university to work only 5% as professor at Karolinska Institute. That was a great decision. The 95% he worked for Gapminder made him a world famous public educator, or Edutainer as he liked to call it.\n\nAcross the world, millions of people use our tools and share our vision of a fact-based worldview that everyone can understand. We know that many will be saddened by this message. Hans is no longer alive, but he will always be with us and his dream of a fact-based worldview, we will never let die!\n\nWe kindly ask you to respect our need for privacy during this sad time of mourning.

[Update: even if you are pursuing a biology, business or social studies degree - you can take modules in computer programming or statistics or data science modules as part of your degree program]\n\nBootcamps and online training adds some breadth to your knowledge and should be part of a continually self-learning habit to be a great data scientist/AI engineer - given that this field is evolving so fast.\n\nQuestions I get asked often (and answers) of what do I need to do to get into data science:\n\n1) Do I need to know programming? A: YES. Preferably Python AND R. Note that I use AND and not OR. The reason begin that interesting papers and code are released every day, and depending on the author - the code examples could in Python or R... so it would be good to be proficient in both but SUPER in one.\n\n2) Do I need to know statistics? A: YES - at least stats, probability and linear algebra 101 as a start and progress from there as you narrow into your specific business domain.\n\n3) I can't (or do not like to) program/code. How? A: You should reconsider if data science is right for you.\n\n4) What other skills should I know as data scientist?  \nA: \na) Besides R and Python. Pick up SQL (yes, I have come across PhDs in Stats with no SQL knowledge!). \n\nb) Python for text processing (you cannot always depend on IT to process your data for you)\n\nc) Spark framework\n\nd) High performance/distributed computing basics in terms of architecture, scalability issues and latency. Why?\n- I had a client once which complained that our software (RevoR) did not show the promise of scalability, when he added more nodes to the cluster from 1 node to 5 nodes.. the RevoR code did not speed up at all.\n- I then asked him how big his dataset was. He replied 10MB.\n\nI leave the answer to question 4(d) as an exercise to those interested - as to why he did not see any speed improvement.""",,http://www.techrepublic.com/article/3-career-paths-to-becoming-a-data-scientist/

A technical paper describing the optimization is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07749 . It is available as free and open source software. This release is just the first step toward providing a suite of algorithms that will assist biomedical researchers in analyzing their data to obtain causal insights.    Using simulated data, FGS was able to learn a causal network on data containing 50,000 variables and 1,000 samples in about 15 minutes on a laptop computer. While FGS does not model hidden variables that cause two or more measured variables, an upcoming release of another algorithm will do so.\nFGS is available as a command line implementation (Causal-cmd) that calls a local Java library or as a Java web application (Causal-web) that runs the analysis at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center; the API?s can also be run through R (R-causal) or Python (Py-causal). Additional details and instructions for downloading both these versions of the software are available at http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Tools_and_Software .\nOur goal is to help the biomedical community use causal modeling to gain novel insights and drive innovative research, so we hope to make these tools as usable and useful as possible.

Nonetheless, there are a few members voicing concerns.\n\nAttendance taking aims to ensure (i) responsible community members can attend our meetups, (ii) venue space is not wasted on no-shows, (iii) proper estimation and minimal wastage of refreshments catered (like at the AXA meetup yesterday). Wastage is bad and inefficient--whether payment for venue or refreshment is involved is moot.\n\nThe attendance board is informational: to allow members to check their attendance record. Members also want their attendance to be acknowledged, and recognised as part of the community (and a regular). We hope it doesn't come across as shaming?though people should be ashamed for RSVPing and not showing up, denying space to other members.\n\nWe understand the attendance board is unusual, almost as unusual as our RSVP issues?ah first world problems! While it may take some getting used to,  the aim is to serve the majority of the community. =)\n\nThink of DSSG as an open-source project. Features include meet-ups (on monthly basis with distinguished speakers), Facebook group (with generous sharing of informative articles), etc. Patches are welcome (e.g., venue with central location that doesn't collect emails of attendees). We can?t please all users but we?ll try our best to serve the community with regard to the meet-up feature.\n\nRegarding privacy concerns, the information (user name and attendance) is neither personal, confidential, high-risk, nor illegal?it is provided when you register and RSVP. The attendance board merely aggregates the information and shows who the regulars are.\n\nFor others who are against this on the grounds that it is childish/pointless, perhaps you can elaborate more?

Given the number of admins we have in the group, it will be fast to approve the posts.

Years later as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, she focused her senior thesis on how data mining the ""deep Web"" could be used to identify traffickers and help victims. Today, Kennedy is the founder and CEO of Marinus Analytics, a Pittsburgh technology start-up whose Traffic Jam software has already aided in the rescue of 120 victims of human trafficking in the US. \n\nThe artificial intelligence-powered software program works by looking for patterns in publicly accessible information such as cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses in the advertisements that sex traffickers use to promote their services. Connections can lead to individuals who are involved in trafficking, both the ringleaders of trafficking rings and the victims who are being exploited. As Kennedy explains, ""What prompted me to start this project was learning that while technology has empowered criminals to more efficiently exploit their victims, law enforcement doesn\'t have the time or the ability to develop the technology to respond.""\n\nKennedy first began work on Traffic Jam as a research analyst at the Auton Lab in CMU?s School of Computer Science, which has received grant support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to study how data mining can be used to help track sex traffickers. Last year, she was able to make Marinus a stand-alone venture, which led to ?the biggest influx of funding we?ve received?: a $200,000 runner-up prize in July?s inaugural UpPrize competition, which recognizes technology companies with a strong social mission.\n\nSo far, multiple law enforcement agencies across the US have made use of Traffic Jam, including the FBI\'s Pittsburgh office where special agent Gregory Heeb said that software has ""helped us to find a number of subjects and locate minors that were involved online."" In the long-term, Kennedy also sees applications for Traffic Jam beyond sex trafficking into other areas where significant criminal activity occurs online such as drug smuggling, money laundering, and monitoring terrorist/hate group activity. \n\nMost importantly, Traffic Jam has potential to stop these crimes at the root: by catching the people who organize them. In speaking about their efforts to end sex trafficking, Kennedy says, ?The goal and mission of our project is to shine a light on those hiding in the shadows so that law enforcement can get the people who are behind these crimes, not just rescue the victims who are out in the open.?\n\nYou can read more about Emily Kennedy and her Traffic Jam software on the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at http://bit.ly/1Ettw8z or check out her website at http://www.marinusanalytics.com/\n\nFor an excellent though challenging novel about one Nepalese girl\'s experience being trafficked into prostitution, we highly recommend ""Sold"" for readers 14 and up at http://www.amightygirl.com/sold \n\nTo learn more about human trafficking, as well as about the exploitation of girls and women in general, we highly recommend ""Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide"" at http://www.amightygirl.com/half-the-sky and the accompanying documentary, for ages 13 and up, at http://www.amightygirl.com/half-the-sky-documentary \n\nMany girls and women are vulnerable to trafficking due to poverty; for a fantastic book full of ideas on how you can help empower girls and women around the world, check out the ""100 Under $100: One Hundred Tools for Empowering Global Women"" at http://amzn.to/1H9CoRl\n\nIf your Mighty Girl is inspired to find a way to change the world, check out the excellent new book, ?Be A Changemaker: How to Start Something That Matters,"" for ages 12 and up at http://www.amightygirl.com/be-a-changemaker\n\nAnd, if you\'d like to encourage your Mighty Girl\'s interest in technology and all the ways that it can be applied, check out our post: ""Inspiring Invention: 25 Engineering, Technology, & Math Toys for Mighty Girls"" at http://www.amightygirl.com/blog?p=7896'",,https://www.facebook.com/amightygirl/photos/a.360833590619627.72897.316489315054055/900776299958684/?type=3

I hope this is okay to post here.\n\nSay I have a test-set with no response variable and riddled with NAs for numerical variables.\n\nSome of these numerical variables turn up high in the variance importance, but have around 5% of entries being NA.\n\nWhat is the normal approach to filling these NAs so that random forests can actually churn out a prediction for the rows with these NAs?\n\nStuff I have tried: na.roughfix, aka filling NAs with column medians, probably not a good idea since its too simplistic.\n\nrfImpute, using one of the predictors as response. since rfImpute requires a response variable to do its magic. Due to the fact that I have a predictor having no NA and this predictor and the predictor I am trying to fill having strong relationships.\n\nfor example,\nGender noOfShoes\nM 4\nM 6\nF 24\nF 40\nF NA\n\nSay I am trying to predict income level of Individuals. the NA in row 5 is bothering me as when I do predictions, due to the nature of RF the prediction for row 5 will be NA.

He then briefly worked on personalization in e-commerce, before accepting the challenge to play with Skyscanner?s data in their newest office in Sofia.\n\nPlamen Aleksandrov also graduated from Sofia University, and specialised in Meta-search Heuristics for Discrete Optimization in JKU Linz, Austria. He later worked on a flight search engine and discovered the nitty-gritty specifics and complexities of the Airline Distribution Industry, before joining Skyscanner in Sofia.\n\nTime: Wednesday, July 29, 19:00\nRegistration starts at 18:30\nVenue: betahaus\n\nSummary:\nHave you ever searched for a flight online? Do you wonder when and where you can get the best price for your travel plans? And, why are there different flight prices? Now, do you want to hear about why it is hard to do a meta-search engine for travel, and especially for flights?\n\nAbout Skyscanner:\nSkyscanner is a leading travel search site offering unbiased, comprehensive and free flight, hotel and car hire search services, used by over 40 million unique visitors every month. Skyscanner opened its office in Sofia in October 2014 and is quickly growing its team here to help solve complex travel problems and continually improve their product.\n\nThe meetup will end with informal networking and beer in the betacafe.\n\nSeating is limited and Facebook RSVP is not enough. To attend this event you need to register and take your FREE ticket from Eventbrite.

My fellow ASEAN Power Shift delegates and I are hosting a ""data sprint"" event tomorrow afternoon. We will be analysing data that came through from a 1-month online survey of what Singapore youths think on climate change, and what they want to see now and in the next 20 years. We received responses too from Singapore residents who are not exactly youth but want to have their say also. These data will be used to formulate a concise national position paper which we want to submit to the competent authorities in the local government.'",b'event',"b""Let's sprint into data - What Singapore youths think of climate change""","b""[What this event is about]\nASEAN Power Shift's Singapore delegate team is conducting an online survey to canvas for perceptions and thoughts of Singapore youths on climate change, and what is being done to address it. \n\nThe survey: http://bit.do/APS15_SGYouthVoice\n\nThe responses are key to formulating a national position paper, which will be submitted to the relevant authorities in the local government.\n\nIn a ASEAN Power Shift conference later this month, we will be aligning the position paper with that of other countries in the region to form a regional position paper. This regional position paper will be submitted to the ASEAN Secretariat and also to the President of global UN climate negotiations to be held at Paris in Dec 2015.\n\nThe survey closes on 21 Jul, but we also intend to complete most of our data analysis by then, in order to formulate the position paper, in time for the ASEAN Power Shift conference from 24th Jul. \n\nAs the survey has a number of open-ended questions, we foresee that it will take us some time to dig through the questions and gain insights from the data.\n\nHence, we decided to see if there are any data scientists out there willing to give us a hand in coming up with good insights together :)\n\nThe team has done some initial analysis, and will share what we have analysed to date. We will also share the data for use in the event, with data anonymised before-hand, to ensure confidentiality.\n\n[When]\n18 Jul Sat, 1pm to 6pm\n\n[Where]\nMeeting room 901, \n9th floor of One Marina Boulevard, 018989\n(Take glass lift outside the building to 8th floor, then escalator up by 1 floor. Turn left, walk down the corridor, and room 902 is the 2nd room to your left)\n\nThe ASEAN Power Shift organisers helped us reserve the room for free - thanks guys :)\n\n[Important]\nBring your own laptop, charger, resources for data analysis. And a sweater if you need\n\n[Contact person]\nPlease RSVP if you are coming by leaving a comment in this event page!

My fellow ASEAN Power Shift delegates and I are hosting a ""data sprint"" event tomorrow (18 Jul) afternoon. We will be analysing data that came through from a 1-month online survey of what Singapore youths think on climate change, and what they want to see now and in the next 20 years. We received responses too from Singapore residents who are not exactly youth but want to have their say also. These data will be used to formulate a concise national position paper which we want to submit to the competent authorities in the local government.'",b'event',"b""Let's sprint into data - What Singapore youths think of climate change""","b""[What this event is about]\nASEAN Power Shift's Singapore delegate team is conducting an online survey to canvas for perceptions and thoughts of Singapore youths on climate change, and what is being done to address it. \n\nThe survey: http://bit.do/APS15_SGYouthVoice\n\nThe responses are key to formulating a national position paper, which will be submitted to the relevant authorities in the local government.\n\nIn a ASEAN Power Shift conference later this month, we will be aligning the position paper with that of other countries in the region to form a regional position paper. This regional position paper will be submitted to the ASEAN Secretariat and also to the President of global UN climate negotiations to be held at Paris in Dec 2015.\n\nThe survey closes on 21 Jul, but we also intend to complete most of our data analysis by then, in order to formulate the position paper, in time for the ASEAN Power Shift conference from 24th Jul. \n\nAs the survey has a number of open-ended questions, we foresee that it will take us some time to dig through the questions and gain insights from the data.\n\nHence, we decided to see if there are any data scientists out there willing to give us a hand in coming up with good insights together :)\n\nThe team has done some initial analysis, and will share what we have analysed to date. We will also share the data for use in the event, with data anonymised before-hand, to ensure confidentiality.\n\n[When]\n18 Jul Sat, 1pm to 6pm\n\n[Where]\nMeeting room 901, \n9th floor of One Marina Boulevard, 018989\n(Take glass lift outside the building to 8th floor, then escalator up by 1 floor. Turn left, walk down the corridor, and room 902 is the 2nd room to your left)\n\nThe ASEAN Power Shift organisers helped us reserve the room for free - thanks guys :)\n\n[Important]\nBring your own laptop, charger, resources for data analysis. And a sweater if you need\n\n[Contact person]\nPlease RSVP if you are coming by leaving a comment in this event page!

I want to dive into DNA sequence analysis, specifically as to how I can identify matching ancestral segments in raw DNA data files from the three main DTC's (23andme, FTDNA and AncestryDNA).\n\nA bit background, the data files per tested customer have between 577-708k SNP (basically mutations or copying errors) in it. That's a lot of columns of data for very little rows in comparison (currently about 2.5 million autosomal tests have been processed - customer can do test at more than one company).\n\nIndustry wide the current minimum criteria is to have 700 of those SNP's matching with someone else (on the same chromosome and overlapping segment). Segments that we inherit from our parents are very rarely a complete 1:1 copy of one parent's chromosome, usually there are between 1-3 crossover (meaning the chromosome is constructed from alternating pairs of segments from our parents chromosome, just the reverse or for the other copy of the same chromosome). It's not clear where these crossover happen unless you can compare your DNA data against one or both parents data (called phasing).\n\nI can explain more details about it but let's come to my main question for this group. How can I identify in the fastest (meaning with the minimum amount of comparisons) way where exactly two persons DNA is matching on an overlapping segment on a given chromosome?\n\nIf you imagine that you start with just 1000 samples the comparison can for sure be done gene-by-gene (brute force) but every new sample has to be compared against all other samples for all of the 46 chromosome pairs (23 x 2) and the above total amount of genes between 600-700k. That very soon gets into an enormous job.\n\nNow given that I think you guys have a very broad knowledge of different statistical approaches and use cases, what are your ideas to tackle such a problem in a smarter way (than brute force)?\n\nSurely if the whole algorithm is running on Amazon's cloud the scalability is basically only limited by the amount of money you want to throw at it but given that I'm not Bill Gates or some other rich dude I need a more practical idea to limit the computation time (and memory, not so much disc space I think).\n\nThanks for reading until here, looking forward to hear your thoughts!""",b'status',b'',b'',,

Cuifen will be providing an introduction to the online ArcGIS tool-- a free online alternative to the ArcGIS tool commonly used in mapping--as well as providing some examples of the work it can create. While mapping is often seen as a researcher?s tool, it is also a great way of expressing the work you?ve done, the places you?ve been visually?for your personal website or for a campaign. Check out what she?s done so far (http://tiny.cc/ylitwx) for @[446371078860565:274:Crop Things], a citizen-led initiative that aims to map edible gardens and ?grow-spots? in Singapore. This session will also include a short sharing on another available software, Google Maps, and quick tricks to simplify mapping and data collection with Google Drive.\n\nCuifen is a visual story-teller who creates maps and illustrations to help decision makers and the general public visualise the natural environment, and our interactions with it. Having initiated her edible community garden in her neighbourhood, she is always looking to learn more, collaborate more, and share more. As a long-time user of ArcGIS, she has recently begun experimenting with the online software to create online maps. She welcomes an active interchange of ideas with the audience, be it about mapping, other mapping tools and gardens!'",Making Maps: Visual Storytelling with ArcGIS and Google Maps,https://www.facebook.com/events/838303122901747/

If you\'re interested you can write to me directly with your CV at njachowski [at] gmail.com.\n---------------------------------------\nI\'m looking for what I would call a ""Dual Stack"" data scientist. The person should have the full gamut of technical experience ranging from being able to set-up and manage linux servers, to developing databases, to writing scalable production code. Must have strong scripting and general data-related hacking skills. The languages we tend to use include SQL, Python, R and a lot of Bash, but anything goes as long as it gets the job done.\n\nThe other side of the ""Dual Stack"" is the business (non-technical) side. We are a part of the global sales team so the role would involve significant interaction with internal and external clients involving 10-20% travel both regionally and globally. \n\nMy team is like a small start-up within the bigger organisation. We hack on top of the vast data sources at TripAdvisor to develop high impact products for the CPC (cost per click) Hotel Auction. It\'s very fast moving and business orientated. The type of person most likely to succeed in the role would probably have at least a master\'s degree in a computationally heavy field, deep technical start-up experience in addition to very good teamwork, people and sales skills.\n\nThe position would be based in Singapore and would work directly with me.

For example, in the case of a Neural Network, we can think about optimizing the number of hidden units, the learning rate, or the regularization weight. In order to tune these, you need to train and test several different combinations of hyperparameters and pick the best one for your final model. \n\nA naive approach is to simply perform an exhaustive grid search over the different possible combinations of reasonable hyperparameters. However, when faced with a complex model where training each one is time consuming and there are many hyperparameters to tune, it can be prohibitively costly to perform such exhaustive grid searches. Luckily, you can do better than this by thinking of parameter tuning as an optimization problem in itself.""'",b'link',b'The Netflix Tech Blog: Distributed Neural Networks with GPUs in the AWS Cloud',b'',techblog.netflix.com,http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/02/distributed-neural-networks-with-gpus.html

University, Istanbul, Turkey & Visiting Scientist, SIMTech\n\n26 May 2014 | 3:00pm ? 5.00pm | \nSIMTech Training Room 1, Tower Block, Level 3\nSingapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) \n71 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 638075\n\nRegister Here :\nhttp://ems.a-star.edu.sg/Registration.aspx?RI=SIMTech&EventNo=20140035 \n________________________________________\n\nSynopsis\nAs the global energy demand is increasing, the share of renewable energy and specifically wind energy in the supply is growing. While vast literature exists on the design and operation of wind turbines, there exists a gap in the literature with regards to the investigation and analysis of wind turbine accidents. The richest publicly available source of information on wind turbines are the news articles that appear in wind industry periodicals and Internet websites. Yet, this information has not yet been harvested and analysed for the benefit of human safety and the wind energy and related industries. \n\nThis paper describes the application of text mining and machine learning techniques for discovering actionable insights and knowledge from news articles on wind turbine accidents. The applied analysis methods are text processing, clustering, multidimensional scaling (MDS), ranking, and linear projection. These methods have been combined under a single analysis framework, and new insights have been discovered for the domain. The results of our research can be used by wind turbine manufacturers, engineering companies, insurance companies, and government institutions to address problem areas and enhance systems and processes. \n\nThis talk will cover the concept, latest technologies and potential applications of text mining to automate the knowledge discovery process on the unstructured business and operation data. \n \nProgramme\n \n3:00pm            Registration\n3:30pm            Unstructured Data Mining ?

He received his B.S. from Industrial Engineering Department of Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 1994, and his Ph.D. from School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, in 2001. He has been awarded with Bogazici University Alumni Scholarship, Hac? Omer Sabanci Scholarship, and Fulbright Scholarship throughout his education. His research areas include knowledge-based systems, warehousing and material handling, and data visualisation and mining. He has research collaborations with institutions including WMG at University of Warwick and A*STAR SIMTech. \n\nDr Ertek has taught more than 2000 students in lecture-styled courses and has supervised one-to-one more than 500 students in project courses, such as PROJ 102 (Project Course) and ENS 491 (Senior Project). He has also served as a reviewer for 50+ R&D projects submitted to T\x9aB?TAK (Turkish National Science Foundation).  \n\nWho Should Attend\nIndustry partners, directors, senior management staff, managers, engineers, academic staff will find the lecture very useful.\n\nRegistration \nThis lecture is free of charge.

Since then, social media websites have grown to encompass many types of photo, video, audio, and even hyper-link sharing. Many researchers have conducted work on these social-websites in general yet there still exists many opportunities to explore how people engage with media online, specifically multimedia, in social contexts. In this talk, I will highlight some new challenges for researchers studying social photography and present a few recent findings from my lab's investigation of Flickr which include geographic annotation of photographs and regions, community congregation online, and social engagement. \n\nBio:\nDavid Ayman Shamma (Yahoo! Research, USA) is a senior research scientist and head of the HCI Research group at Yahoo! Labs and the scientific liaison to Flickr. His personal research investigates synchronous environments and connected experiences both online and in-the-world. Focusing on creative expression and sharing frameworks, he designs and prototypes systems for multimedia-mediated communication, as well as, develops targeted methods and metrics for understanding how people communicate online in small environments and at web scale.\n\n-----\nThese monthly meetings are co-organized by Singapore-based HCI researchers from: Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R, A*STAR), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore Management University (SMU), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and Keio-NUS CUTE Center.""",b'link',b'David Ayman Shamma | Yahoo Labs',b'',labs.yahoo.com,http://labs.yahoo.com/author/shamma/

Please join us for his presentation on scalable cross-platform R-based Predictive Analytics.  Event is free and open to all so feel free extend the invitation to other associates who may be keen as well.  Seat is limited to first 80 pax.\n\nLocation: Mapletree Business City, 10 Pasir Panjang Road\n \nAgenda:\n1. Introduction to Revolution R, COA and COE ? 10 mins\n2. Introduction to Big Data Analytics with Hadoop ? 25 mins (guest speaker)\n3. Scalable Cross-Platform R-Based Predictive Analytics ? 45 mins (Mario)\n \nAbstract:\nIn this talk we will discover how to perform predictive analytics scalably using an R-based tool across a wide range of platforms: Windows and Linux laptops and workstations, multicore servers, Hadoop and MPI clusters, and massively parallel databases. We will take a tour through an end-to-end predictive analytics session, starting by exploring our data with summaries and histograms. Using the knowledge gleaned from data exploration, we will create transformations to clean our data and prepare it for model building. Next, we will establish a prediction baseline by performing linear regression. Then we will apply an advanced iterative algorithm to push prediction to the limit. Finally, we will use this high quality model to score new data, completing the prediction workflow.\n \nIf you are keen, kindly RSVP with Ms Pearleen Lui at pearleen.lui@revolutionanalytics.com by this Friday, 29 Nov 2013. Thank You.'",b'status',b'',b'',,
