I was wondering how everyone version-controls their data. 

Small CSV files etc. can be easily put into Git. However, there doesn't seem to be too many alternatives for things like data within a database or larger files such like binary files (that are not line/recrod-based) that need versioning. 

I have come across some ideas from several blog posts that revolve around using Git, or other version control systems

 - https://github.com/leeper/data-versioning
 - https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/5178/how-to-deal-with-version-control-of-large-amounts-of-binary-data
 - http://www.cs.umd.edu/~amol/DBGroup/2015/06/26/datahub.html

Approaches to versioning a DB appear here:

 - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/323065/how-to-version-control-a-record-in-a-database

This basically talks about generating a ""history log"" table. Problems occur when the table scheama's or the database schema changes.

Some commercial tools are available such as:

 - https://datproject.org
 - https://quiltdata.com

Problems here are that you may not want your data in public servers (which is a big concern for a lot of companies), and that there doesn't seem to be any form of dependency management. Furthermore, most of the solutions don't appear to be very mature (like Git for example). 

So in summary, I was wondering what strategies people use for their data management tasks.",link,leeper/data-versioning,data-versioning - Collecting thoughts about data versioning,github.com,https://github.com/leeper/data-versioning

Now, unless you have been living in a cave, you'd be well aware of the recent news story of how United Airlines removed David Dao from an aircraft.

In the last few months I have worked really hard to put together a introductory course in data coding for those, who are new to Data Science. I’ve selected bash (aka. the command line) as the first data language to show you, because I find it easy to interpret – even for first timers. In my articles I’ve started “the story” from the very beginning, so if you have never touched coding/programming so far, don’t worry, you will understand everything. My main focus was to keep everything easy-to-follow, but also practical and hands-on.

If you go through these 7 articles, you will learn how to do basic data cleaning, data formatting and analytics at the command line. On the top of that you will have your own data server to practice – we will use that not only here, but in my future SQL, Python and R tutorials too.

The whole point of this series of visualizations is to look at budget data from a longer-term data-centric point of view.

It is my hope that a more people will be interested in the data.

A data-literate society will help to fight against the fake news trend that other parts of the world are moving towards.

This year the government's budget is pretty balanced and nothing super noteworthy stands out. Yes, health budget is projected to still increase year-on-year. Transport spend will taper down a bit.

However, with these facts we can conclusively make statements based on fact. E.g. Defence spending, viz-a-viz spending as a percentage against the whole has been falling since the mid 2000s.

We are extremely sad to announce that Professor Hans Rosling died this morning. Hans suffered from a pancreatic cancer which was diagnosed one year ago. He passed away early Tuesday morning, February 7, 2017, surrounded by his family in Uppsala, Sweden.

Eleven years ago, the three of us, Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling & Anna Rosling Rönnlund founded Gapminder. In 2007 Hans decided to “drop out” of university to work only 5% as professor at Karolinska Institute. That was a great decision. The 95% he worked for Gapminder made him a world famous public educator, or Edutainer as he liked to call it.

Across the world, millions of people use our tools and share our vision of a fact-based worldview that everyone can understand. We know that many will be saddened by this message. Hans is no longer alive, but he will always be with us and his dream of a fact-based worldview, we will never let die!

We kindly ask you to respect our need for privacy during this sad time of mourning. Gapminder will announce info about memorial plans later.

Stay updated on Gapminder’s twitter and facebook

I am interested in making a career switch to data analyst and I have come across this Professional Conversion programme for data analyst by WSQ. I have contacted them and was informed that they are currently looking for companies to participate in this program and will look out for potential matches. Alternatively, I could contact companies myself who require data analyst and convince them to hire me under this programme. 

So I would like to know if anybody here knows any company that might be interested. If so, I would appreciate anybody who can drop me a message. If anyone is interested in knowing more about this programme, you can click on this link

To share a personal insight how how important it is to know the domain you are working in.

We were involved in a large IOT manufacturing customer site and collecting data for analysis... Our data scientist just couldn't figure out the odd behavior of the data and what the engineers told us... After much probing and asking on-site and offsite.. we finally found the problem. The customers system time-stamped data were not in sync. We then adjusted for the difference and everything fell in place.

So do not just except the raw data as truths... Understand the underlying domain helps to ensure incoming data is correct and as data scientist, you have to have a feel of the data and the model and the physical characteristics (in our case above) of the shop floor.

""``There's an arms race in training data'' for AI, said Chief Executive Officer Matt Bencke.

IBM, with its focus on Watson AI products, wanted to create a chat bot for spectators at the 2016 Masters golf tournament it sponsors. Using tablets on site or their own mobile phones, golf fans would be able to ask the bot questions or banter with it. The only problem? IBM couldn't find enough annotated golf-related training data. 

So IBM sent Mighty AI a large body of information culled from the web that it thought was related to golf. Mighty AI found workers familiar with golf,  had them tag information specific to the sport and compose questions and answers based on the material. That data became the basis of IBM's Watson golf conversational agent.""",link,This Startup Pays Real People to Answer Questions to Build Better AI,"To set up effective artificial intelligence software, a company needs a lot of data.

""Rather than it being a fourth paradigm, we think of data-intensive methods as supplemental to existing methods — a way to expand dimensionality, discover potentially new relationships, and refine theory. Clearly, data-intensive methods are important complements to experimentation, theoretical models, computer modeling, and simulation because they take us into a realm beyond what such methods are capable of today. Researchers just need to be careful about how they use them. ""

157938781081987_570936273115567,Laurence Liew,10203226535864086,2017-01-04T03:36:15+0000,,link,Laurence,"Bootcamps and online courses is good for beginners to get a taste of what data science/AI is all about.

However, I think a formal degree or better from a University with emphasis on mathematics, statistics and programming is a pre-requisite.  [Update: even if you are pursuing a biology, business or social studies degree - you can take modules in computer programming or statistics or data science modules as part of your degree program]

Bootcamps and online training adds some breadth to your knowledge and should be part of a continually self-learning habit to be a great data scientist/AI engineer - given that this field is evolving so fast.

Questions I get asked often (and answers) of what do I need to do to get into data science:

1) Do I need to know programming? A: YES. Preferably Python AND R. Note that I use AND and not OR. The reason begin that interesting papers and code are released every day, and depending on the author - the code examples could in Python or R... so it would be good to be proficient in both but SUPER in one.

2) Do I need to know statistics? A: YES - at least stats, probability and linear algebra 101 as a start and progress from there as you narrow into your specific business domain.

3) I can't (or do not like to) program/code. How? A: You should reconsider if data science is right for you.

4) What other skills should I know as data scientist?  
A: 
a) Besides R and Python. Pick up SQL (yes, I have come across PhDs in Stats with no SQL knowledge!). 

b) Python for text processing (you cannot always depend on IT to process your data for you)

c) Spark framework

d) High performance/distributed computing basics in terms of architecture, scalability issues and latency. Why?
- I had a client once which complained that our software (RevoR) did not show the promise of scalability, when he added more nodes to the cluster from 1 node to 5 nodes.. the RevoR code did not speed up at all.
- I then asked him how big his dataset was. He replied 10MB.

I leave the answer to question 4(d) as an exercise to those interested - as to why he did not see any speed improvement.",,http://www.techrepublic.com/article/3-career-paths-to-becoming-a-data-scientist/

When I was in Revolution Analytics, our Enterprise R used Intel MKL to get a large performance boost for certain R algorithms. So it is good to see Intel stepping up and introducing:

- Intel Distribution for Python (nice high performance Python package!)

- Intel Math Kernel Library (the ""gold"" standard in numerical libraries)

- Intel MKL for Deep Neural Networks

- Intel Data Analytics library (watch out!!! RevoR/MFST R)

In the vein of cleaning up old visualizations and adding new data, several visualizations have been updated at Visualizing Singapore (viz.sg)

Dengue + Zika heatmap is now permanently live, and it updates every day on the most current up to date information. There has also been quite a few usability updates.

It doesn't mean that there is less news about Zika that it does not exist. It does. If you're concerned, bookmark this live site!

If you're interested in the details behind the dengue + zika updates, you can find them here:
http://www.vslashr.com/2016/09/dengue-zika-visualization-updates/

Lastly, there has been updates to the age and gender data visualization. Data has been updated to latest 2016 June statistics, and the UI has been improved upon.

Again, if you're interested in some of the thoughts behind the UX design and implementation, you can find it here:

Lastly, a shoutout to those who do data visualizations on Singapore: Please ping me as I would love to add your work to Visualizing Singapore, a non-profit ground-up community site.

    Change management to the fore: evidence-based decision-making requires management to contemplate new organizational forms
    Invisible architectures: enterprise architecture embraces systems management to forge a path through the mist of multi-systems complexity

    On-ramping AI: organizational operationalization as a step towards machine automation

""The human brain [forms] rules by memorizing everyday events (sparrows can fly and pigeons can fly) and generalizing those learnings to apply to things we haven't seen before (animals with wings can fly). Perhaps more powerfully, memorization also allows us to further refine our generalized rules with exceptions (penguins can't fly). ... Can we teach computers to learn like humans do, by combining the power of memorization and generalization?

It's not an easy question to answer, but by jointly training a wide linear model (for memorization) alongside a deep neural network (for generalization), one can combine the strengths of both to bring us one step closer. At Google, we call it Wide & Deep Learning. It's useful for generic large-scale regression and classification problems with sparse inputs (categorical features with a large number of possible feature values), such as recommender systems, search, and ranking problems.""",link,Wide & Deep Learning: Better Together with TensorFlow,,research.googleblog.com,https://research.googleblog.com/2016/06/wide-deep-learning-better-together-with.html

A technical paper describing the optimization is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07749 . It is available as free and open source software. This release is just the first step toward providing a suite of algorithms that will assist biomedical researchers in analyzing their data to obtain causal insights.    Using simulated data, FGS was able to learn a causal network on data containing 50,000 variables and 1,000 samples in about 15 minutes on a laptop computer. While FGS does not model hidden variables that cause two or more measured variables, an upcoming release of another algorithm will do so.
FGS is available as a command line implementation (Causal-cmd) that calls a local Java library or as a Java web application (Causal-web) that runs the analysis at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center; the API’s can also be run through R (R-causal) or Python (Py-causal). Additional details and instructions for downloading both these versions of the software are available at http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Tools_and_Software .
Our goal is to help the biomedical community use causal modeling to gain novel insights and drive innovative research, so we hope to make these tools as usable and useful as possible. We welcome any and all feedback that you might have, which will help us improve this and future releases.",link,Center for Causal Discovery,"Home Data Science Development of algorithms, software, & system architecture to discover causality in big data Biomedical Science Discovery of causal knowledge in big data for cancer driver mutations, lung fibrosis, & brain connectome Training Interactive & downloadable materials for data scientists…",ccd.pitt.edu,http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/

As you may already have noticed, we have been tracking attendance at our meetups! This is to prevent people who always RSVP but do not show up! 

So this is the leaderboard that we have created to show your current score. It also shows the attendance we taken at each meetup. In future, you can refer to this sheet to check if your attendance is taken! (not necessary imo) 

The scores means the following:
-1 means you RSVP-ed but did not show up, 
 0 means you did not register and did not turn up,
1 means you RSVP-ed and turn up! 

if there is any error  or requests such as

1) your name is not unique (thus full join error)
2) you like your name changed
3) or you did turn up but for some reason it marks you as -1

Please let any of us know and we will edit accordingly! 

For the curious: in the spirit of Data Science, we actually used R-shiny and googlesheets as a way of persistent storage to log our attendance so we can easily compute our leaderboard. Saves paper and the environment too!

We will have a tutorial session on Neo4j at our February meetup!

Here are the details:
Tutorial: Neo4j and Python for Dummies by Eric C.Y. Lee 

Eric will give an introduction to graph database and Neo4j. He will demonstrate how you can install and setup Neo4j. He will explain some simple ""Cypher Query Language"" syntaxes. After you have basic knowledge of Neo4j, Eric will guide you through an exercise.

If you would like to follow along, bring along a laptop, preferably with Linux or Mac OSX and the latest copy of Neo4j 2.3 at http://neo4j.com/download. The community version is fine, although the Enterprise version is better.

RSVP is opened! See http://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/226837758/",,http://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/226837758/

This video featured on Microsoft's Channel 9 shows how one can perform interactive log analysis and data visualization with Jupyter notebook and PySpark (Python Spark) on a Apache Spark cluster (Linux) on the Azure HDInsight.

The same tools are applicable for other big data scenario on other big data cloud platform.  

Key takeaways:
- Basics of Apache Spark, RDD, HDInsight
- Basics of Jupyter Notebook, PySpark libraries
- Custom Python library for easy and efficient IIS log parsing
- Sample Code on GitHub

What if you want to create a machine learning model but realized that your input dataset doesn’t fit your computer memory? Usual you would use distributed computing tools like Hadoop and Apache Spark for that computation in a cluster with many machines. However, Apache Spark is able to process your data in local machine standalone mode and even build models when the input data set is larger than the amount of memory your computer has. In this blog post, I’ll show you an end-to-end scenario with Apache Spark where we will be creating a binary classification model using a 34.6 gigabytes of input dataset. Run this scenario in your laptop (yes, yours with its 4-8 gigabytes of memory and 50+ gigabytes of disk space) to test this.

Previously I've shared 3 days worth of logs from my app to some members of this group. That was just about 40k records covering 3 weekdays.

This time, there are 400k rows of data and this data covers the fateful SMRT breakdown on Wednesday (where we see about 3x spike) and the following day.

With the data, you will be able to see every bus timing request made at various bus-stops throughout one full week.

Thought this would be interesting to look at.

Anyone interested to play with the data? See if there's any interesting info graphics or insights you can get out of it.

I would like to pick up your thoughts on the following - As you probably know, SAS has the SAS BIA program (funded by IDA and non-funded one). 

Especially for the non-funded one - where the student would follow the exact same thing as the funded by IDA version. 

Assuming the overall aim is to start a career in analytics (rather than DS) in established large corporate or to some extent, big SMEs (probably cutting out start-ups) 

And all the training will be related to SAS and delivered by SAS itself: SAS programming, SAS SQL, SAS Macro, SAS Enterprise Miner, etc (http://www.bmi-asia.com/sas_form/Program_outline.html) 

> Do you believe it would be wise to go through the programme, and why?
> Looking ahead to the next 10 years - (SAS has been around for 40 years now, considering they have seen it all, almost) - would the expertise in SAS still be relevant? (SAS will upgrade & adapt with time too, I suppose)
> As more companies pop-up and tackling various verticals, would it make sense to be over-reliant on SAS (and its software suites)? 

My main concern is probably the interchangeability of hard skills acquired using SAS over a few years....",link,SAS-BIA PROGRAM,,bmi-asia.com,http://www.bmi-asia.com/sas_form/Program_outline.html

not sure if introducing is common here but I do it anyway ;-)

Some of you might have seen me at the last two meetups that I attended, I'm the guy who can't keep his mouth shut and interrupts presentations with more comments than questions LOL

That being said, I use my different cultural background as an excuse for not following a more Asian behavior. I'm doing what is nowadays called Data Science for 22 years now (since 1993) when many of you were still running around in diapers (no offense, it just means I'm old).

My professional career can be looked up here: https://sg.linkedin.com/in/andreaswest and I'm currently Co-Founder and CEO of Numero Pte Ltd. For more info on what Numero exactly does please visit numero.com.sg (begging for page views lol)

I'm pretty impressed by the quality of this DSSG group and the large variety of work that is done. It's also great to see that not only most of you want to share knowledge but that there is also a friendly environment where nobody should be afraid to present his work.

I'm looking forward to learn more from you, give my occasional comment based more on real experience than on theoretical statistical background and on meeting like minded people.

Army nurses also had other ideas. After the war, realizing this ""data trend"", the small company reinvented itself as a Sanitary pad Giant... :p

""A material called Cellucotton had already been invented before war broke out, by what was then a small US firm - Kimberly-Clark. The company's head of research, Ernst Mahler, and its vice-president, James, C Kimberly, had toured pulp and paper plants in Germany, Austria and Scandinavia in 1914 and spotted a material five times more absorbent than cotton and - when mass-produced - half as expensive.

They took it back to the US and trademarked it. Then, once the US entered the war in 1917, they started producing the wadding for surgical dressing at a rate of 380-500ft per minute.

But Red Cross nurses on the battlefield realised its benefits for their own personal, hygienic use, and it was this unofficial use that ultimately made the company's fortune.

""The end of the war in 1918 brought about a temporary suspension of K-C's wadding business because its principal customers - the army and the Red Cross - no longer had a need for the product,"" the company says today.

So it re-purchased the surplus from the military and created a new market.

""After two years of intensive study, experimentation and market testing, the K-C team created a sanitary napkin made from Cellucotton and fine gauze, and in 1920, in a little wooden shed in Neenah, Wisconsin, female employees began turning out the product by hand,"" the company says.

The new product, called Kotex (short for ""cotton texture""), was sold to the public in October 1920, less than two years after the Armistice.""",link,ichef.bbci.co.uk,,ichef.bbci.co.uk,http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/304/media/images/74245000/jpg/_74245696_kotex-ad.jpg

Gartner and Mckinsey estimate the skill deficit to the tune of 1.5 million- 4.4 million plus. To top it all, Data scientist is rated as the sexiest job of 21st century.
Am sure this has led to most of you to be really interested in continuing your career in analytics and Big data. To address the opportunity, and current issues, we have come-up with a learning platform which will help users to learn business Analytics through real industry scenarios modeled as simulations. Currently our platform is used by a few fortune-500 clients, but we are just making it open for all.

To test this platform we need some individuals who are willing to spare some time(close to an hour) on testing the product and give us feedback from usability point.The volunteers will be getting goodies and coupons.
We would appreciate it, if you can help us make learning better through your feedback.

The good performers in this platform will be given an opportunity to connect with data science hiring officials.

For example, in the case of a Neural Network, we can think about optimizing the number of hidden units, the learning rate, or the regularization weight. In order to tune these, you need to train and test several different combinations of hyperparameters and pick the best one for your final model. 

A naive approach is to simply perform an exhaustive grid search over the different possible combinations of reasonable hyperparameters. However, when faced with a complex model where training each one is time consuming and there are many hyperparameters to tune, it can be prohibitively costly to perform such exhaustive grid searches. Luckily, you can do better than this by thinking of parameter tuning as an optimization problem in itself.""",link,The Netflix Tech Blog: Distributed Neural Networks with GPUs in the AWS Cloud,,techblog.netflix.com,http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/02/distributed-neural-networks-with-gpus.html

Title:
Media, Community, and the Social Photograph 

Abstract:
A decade ago we saw the birth of Flickr, a media website for social photo sharing. Since then, social media websites have grown to encompass many types of photo, video, audio, and even hyper-link sharing. Many researchers have conducted work on these social-websites in general yet there still exists many opportunities to explore how people engage with media online, specifically multimedia, in social contexts. In this talk, I will highlight some new challenges for researchers studying social photography and present a few recent findings from my lab's investigation of Flickr which include geographic annotation of photographs and regions, community congregation online, and social engagement. 

Bio:
David Ayman Shamma (Yahoo! Research, USA) is a senior research scientist and head of the HCI Research group at Yahoo! Labs and the scientific liaison to Flickr. His personal research investigates synchronous environments and connected experiences both online and in-the-world. Focusing on creative expression and sharing frameworks, he designs and prototypes systems for multimedia-mediated communication, as well as, develops targeted methods and metrics for understanding how people communicate online in small environments and at web scale.

Just to give you an idea, my current ranked 14/164 solution for this competition below consists of identifying and removing trend breaking data with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, removing outliers with median absolute deviation and linear ensemble of random forest, support vector machines & generalized boosted regression models on logged, rule based re-classified data. 

It took me 1 month, 37 submissions and 2 years of Kaggle experience to do this. It is not easy. I learnt all these on my own and did countless experiments to fit all these techniques together. But if someone like me who failed junior college maths and almost drop out of school can do it, I am pretty sure anyone can learn these techniques as long as they put in the effort. ^^",link,Description - See Click Predict Fix | Kaggle,"Kaggle is a platform for data prediction competitions.
