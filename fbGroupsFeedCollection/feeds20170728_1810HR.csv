Over the past months, people have RSVPed for meetups and not showed up, or un-RSVPed on the actual day. This denies others members (like yourself!) the chance to attend.

Here's our attendence policy again: 
If RSVP & attend: +1
Else if RSVP & NOT attend: -1
Else if Un-RSVP after deadline: -1

If score <= -3, BAN

The deadline is usually just one day before the actual date. We seek your cooperation on this. Please waitlist if you're keen on attending, and check-in with us if you attend our events, even if you have not RSVP-ed. This helps us assess meetup demand.

Being data-driven, we've analysed this data and noticed a 30% dropout. Thus, we allocate 30% more meetup capacity. ""Sacrificing"" your slot after RSVP deadline is discouraged and leads to -1.

Where possible, we'll collaborate with bigger venues--nonetheless, these sometimes come with string attached (sponsored content, providing your email) or are in less desirable locations.

Thank you for your cooperation!",status,,,,

I will like to build a text summarizer which summarizes a collection feedback into one short paragraph. The length of the text can vary a lot from one sentence to a paragraph.  Can anyone please point me in the direction of high quality relevant useful papers/books and/or to any individual well versed in the topic that I can reach out to? I have done some reading but most refer to summarizing a long form text which has very different characteristics from my data.

Just to share more background context. I have built a professional feedback solution (hoorah.io). So what we have now is lots of feedback about an individual. It is time consuming to have to read through all of them. Of course they are there for reference but I'd like to give a summary of the feedback a person has received thus far as an overview.

Using LDA (thanks Kai Xin Thia laoshi) I could tell that the feedbacks could be classified into a few categories. Mentorship, proactive, helpful, detailed etc. the challenge with this is that I have to manually tune the number of clusters until I find a good separation ( not very scalable ). If I cannot find a way to intelligently summarize automatically, the next alternative is to classify and generate the summaries based on the classifications detected. But it would not be a very good user experience as the summaries will appear pre-canned quite quickly.",status,,,,

I was wondering how everyone version-controls their data. 

Small CSV files etc. can be easily put into Git. However, there doesn't seem to be too many alternatives for things like data within a database or larger files such like binary files (that are not line/recrod-based) that need versioning. 

I have come across some ideas from several blog posts that revolve around using Git, or other version control systems

 - https://github.com/leeper/data-versioning
 - https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/5178/how-to-deal-with-version-control-of-large-amounts-of-binary-data
 - http://www.cs.umd.edu/~amol/DBGroup/2015/06/26/datahub.html

Approaches to versioning a DB appear here:

 - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/323065/how-to-version-control-a-record-in-a-database

This basically talks about generating a ""history log"" table. Problems occur when the table scheama's or the database schema changes.

Some commercial tools are available such as:

 - https://datproject.org
 - https://quiltdata.com

Problems here are that you may not want your data in public servers (which is a big concern for a lot of companies), and that there doesn't seem to be any form of dependency management. Furthermore, most of the solutions don't appear to be very mature (like Git for example). 

So in summary, I was wondering what strategies people use for their data management tasks.",link,leeper/data-versioning,data-versioning - Collecting thoughts about data versioning,ï»¿github.com,ï»¿https://github.com/leeper/data-versioning

And here it is. A data-centric look: Singapore Budget 2017

http://viz.sg/viz/budget2017/

The whole point of this series of visualizations is to look at budget data from a longer-term data-centric point of view.

It is my hope that a more people will be interested in the data.

A data-literate society will help to fight against the fake news trend that other parts of the world are moving towards.

This year the government's budget is pretty balanced and nothing super noteworthy stands out. Yes, health budget is projected to still increase year-on-year. Transport spend will taper down a bit.

However, with these facts we can conclusively make statements based on fact. E.g. Defence spending, viz-a-viz spending as a percentage against the whole has been falling since the mid 2000s.

We are extremely sad to announce that Professor Hans Rosling died this morning. Hans suffered from a pancreatic cancer which was diagnosed one year ago. He passed away early Tuesday morning, February 7, 2017, surrounded by his family in Uppsala, Sweden.

Eleven years ago, the three of us, Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling & Anna Rosling Rnnlund founded Gapminder. In 2007 Hans decided to ?drop out? of university to work only 5% as professor at Karolinska Institute. That was a great decision. The 95% he worked for Gapminder made him a world famous public educator, or Edutainer as he liked to call it.

Across the world, millions of people use our tools and share our vision of a fact-based worldview that everyone can understand. We know that many will be saddened by this message. Hans is no longer alive, but he will always be with us and his dream of a fact-based worldview, we will never let die!

We kindly ask you to respect our need for privacy during this sad time of mourning. Gapminder will announce info about memorial plans later.

Stay updated on Gapminder?s twitter and facebook

Previously we released one week worth of bus stop api pings for you guys to play with visualization of commuters behavior scattered across bus stops in sg on a time series, including data during days of smrt breakdown.

Now I have more data available for grab. An incomplete 1.5gb 1million records worth of data of how crowded each bus service is upon reaching each bus stop at an interval of 10 mins for 7 days a week. By incomplete I mean that there are data gaps for certain 10min slots for some bus services at some stops.

I'm interested to see if we can figure out and recommend to Singaporeans what are the best time to board bus at each stop, identify overcrowded buses and stops, as well as model the peak cycle of every bus at every bus stop. Maybe we can send the end result to LTA and ask them to get operators to deploy more buses?

As always, just ping me at calixto@originally.us and give abit of self intro as well as maybe some links to your online works and I'll send the data over. We won't use the outcome for commercial purposes, just to satisfy our intellectual curiosity. If you are writing about your use of our data, just attribute to SG BusLeh app can already.

Alternatively, I could contact companies myself who require data analyst and convince them to hire me under this programme. 

So I would like to know if anybody here knows any company that might be interested. If so, I would appreciate anybody who can drop me a message. If anyone is interested in knowing more about this programme, you can click on this link

Understand Hogwart?s ghosts, students and professors with R and Neo4j!  Property graph databases like Neo4j are great for storing data about networks; R is a powerful tool for statistical analyses. Used together, they give a fresh take on analyses compared to traditional relational databases.

At the our meetup on the 8th of Februrary 7pm at Pixel Labs, we?ll be doing a code demo on the three most common ways data scientists pair R with Neo4j. We?ll see how R is used to input data into Neo4j, pull in data for interactive plots, and to apply mathematical graph theory to our data. To understand these ?tricks?, we will be helped by Hogwart?s network of ghosts, students, professors, and magical owls.

Great for Potterheads and data geeks alike.

We were involved in a large IOT manufacturing customer site and collecting data for analysis... Our data scientist just couldn't figure out the odd behavior of the data and what the engineers told us... After much probing and asking on-site and offsite.. we finally found the problem. The customers system time-stamped data were not in sync. We then adjusted for the difference and everything fell in place.

--

Join us in this 1 hour free workshop on the art and science of telling stories with data.

Forbes Magazine calls data storytelling 'the essential data science skill everyone needs'. And with good reason ? well told data stories are change drivers within the modern organization. But how do we find the most important insights in our business data and communicate them in a compelling way? How do we connect the data that we have to the key underlying business issue? 

The 1 hour session will cover:

* The essential elements of a good data story

* Chart design and why it matters

* Common chart design errors

* The Gestalt principals of visual perception and how they can be used to tell better stories with data

* Some before and after data story 'make overs'

""``There's an arms race in training data'' for AI, said Chief Executive Officer Matt Bencke.

IBM, with its focus on Watson AI products, wanted to create a chat bot for spectators at the 2016 Masters golf tournament it sponsors. Using tablets on site or their own mobile phones, golf fans would be able to ask the bot questions or banter with it. The only problem? IBM couldn't find enough annotated golf-related training data. 

So IBM sent Mighty AI a large body of information culled from the web that it thought was related to golf. Mighty AI found workers familiar with golf,  had them tag information specific to the sport and compose questions and answers based on the material. That data became the basis of IBM's Watson golf conversational agent.""",link,This Startup Pays Real People to Answer Questions to Build Better AI,"To set up effective artificial intelligence software, a company needs a lot of data.

""Rather than it being a fourth paradigm, we think of data-intensive methods as supplemental to existing methods ? a way to expand dimensionality, discover potentially new relationships, and refine theory. Clearly, data-intensive methods are important complements to experimentation, theoretical models, computer modeling, and simulation because they take us into a realm beyond what such methods are capable of today. Researchers just need to be careful about how they use them. ""

However, I think a formal degree or better from a University with emphasis on mathematics, statistics and programming is a pre-requisite.  [Update: even if you are pursuing a biology, business or social studies degree - you can take modules in computer programming or statistics or data science modules as part of your degree program]

Bootcamps and online training adds some breadth to your knowledge and should be part of a continually self-learning habit to be a great data scientist/AI engineer - given that this field is evolving so fast.

Questions I get asked often (and answers) of what do I need to do to get into data science:

1) Do I need to know programming? A: YES. Preferably Python AND R. Note that I use AND and not OR. The reason begin that interesting papers and code are released every day, and depending on the author - the code examples could in Python or R... so it would be good to be proficient in both but SUPER in one.

2) Do I need to know statistics? A: YES - at least stats, probability and linear algebra 101 as a start and progress from there as you narrow into your specific business domain.

3) I can't (or do not like to) program/code. How? A: You should reconsider if data science is right for you.

4) What other skills should I know as data scientist?  
A: 
a) Besides R and Python. Pick up SQL (yes, I have come across PhDs in Stats with no SQL knowledge!). 

b) Python for text processing (you cannot always depend on IT to process your data for you)

c) Spark framework

d) High performance/distributed computing basics in terms of architecture, scalability issues and latency. Why?
- I had a client once which complained that our software (RevoR) did not show the promise of scalability, when he added more nodes to the cluster from 1 node to 5 nodes.. the RevoR code did not speed up at all.
- I then asked him how big his dataset was. He replied 10MB.

I leave the answer to question 4(d) as an exercise to those interested - as to why he did not see any speed improvement.",,ï»¿http://www.techrepublic.com/article/3-career-paths-to-becoming-a-data-scientist/

In the vein of cleaning up old visualizations and adding new data, several visualizations have been updated at Visualizing Singapore (viz.sg)

Dengue + Zika heatmap is now permanently live, and it updates every day on the most current up to date information. There has also been quite a few usability updates.

It doesn't mean that there is less news about Zika that it does not exist. It does. If you're concerned, bookmark this live site!

http://viz.sg/viz/dengue/

If you're interested in the details behind the dengue + zika updates, you can find them here:
http://www.vslashr.com/2016/09/dengue-zika-visualization-updates/

Lastly, there has been updates to the age and gender data visualization. Data has been updated to latest 2016 June statistics, and the UI has been improved upon.

Again, if you're interested in some of the thoughts behind the UX design and implementation, you can find it here:

http://www.vslashr.com/2016/11/population-by-housing/

Lastly, a shoutout to those who do data visualizations on Singapore: Please ping me as I would love to add your work to Visualizing Singapore, a non-profit ground-up community site.

    Invisible architectures: enterprise architecture embraces systems management to forge a path through the mist of multi-systems complexity
    We?re not in Kansas anymore:  increasingly diffuse models requires a deeper methodological understanding of broader research paradigms
    Living with the paradox: coming to terms with irresolvable methodological quandaries
    Cyborg enterprise:  industrial-scale analytics ushers in the age of highly integrated, large-scale techno-organizational decision programs
    Not for everyone, but necessary none-the-less:  analytics as a service and outsourcing analytics as a function
    On-ramping AI: organizational operationalization as a step towards machine automation

maybe xwindows on android is already there for a while... 
but i'll share anyway, 'cause i just found about it the other day :-P

after installing GNURoot Debian, these are the following extra things i needed to setup to have ggplot2 working on my phone:
1. Build R from source inside the phone (the default R-3.1.1 of r-base doesn't allow you to install ggplot2. On my side, I built 3.1.3 (yeah i know, no pun intended on the mall :-P )
2. Launch R and install.packages(""ggplot2"")
3. I thought I'm done, but required fonts aren't installed by default
so had to do this: apt-get install t1-xfree86-nonfree ttf-xfree86-nonfree ttf-xfree86-nonfree-syriac xfonts-75dpi xfonts-100dpi
4. Remember to restart GNURoot. 
5. Then, relaunch R and tada!!! :-D

Have a great week everyone
and enjoy swimming in the ocean of data ;-)",status,,,,

""The human brain [forms] rules by memorizing everyday events (sparrows can fly and pigeons can fly) and generalizing those learnings to apply to things we haven't seen before (animals with wings can fly). Perhaps more powerfully, memorization also allows us to further refine our generalized rules with exceptions (penguins can't fly). ... Can we teach computers to learn like humans do, by combining the power of memorization and generalization?

It's not an easy question to answer, but by jointly training a wide linear model (for memorization) alongside a deep neural network (for generalization), one can combine the strengths of both to bring us one step closer. At Google, we call it Wide & Deep Learning.

A technical paper describing the optimization is available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07749 . It is available as free and open source software. This release is just the first step toward providing a suite of algorithms that will assist biomedical researchers in analyzing their data to obtain causal insights.    Using simulated data, FGS was able to learn a causal network on data containing 50,000 variables and 1,000 samples in about 15 minutes on a laptop computer. While FGS does not model hidden variables that cause two or more measured variables, an upcoming release of another algorithm will do so.
FGS is available as a command line implementation (Causal-cmd) that calls a local Java library or as a Java web application (Causal-web) that runs the analysis at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center; the API?s can also be run through R (R-causal) or Python (Py-causal). Additional details and instructions for downloading both these versions of the software are available at http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Tools_and_Software .
Our goal is to help the biomedical community use causal modeling to gain novel insights and drive innovative research, so we hope to make these tools as usable and useful as possible. We welcome any and all feedback that you might have, which will help us improve this and future releases.",link,Center for Causal Discovery,"Home Data Science Development of algorithms, software, & system architecture to discover causality in big data Biomedical Science Discovery of causal knowledge in big data for cancer driver mutations, lung fibrosis, & brain connectome Training Interactive & downloadable materials for data scientists?",ï»¿ccd.pitt.edu,ï»¿http://www.ccd.pitt.edu/

As you may already have noticed, we have been tracking attendance at our meetups! This is to prevent people who always RSVP but do not show up! 

So this is the leaderboard that we have created to show your current score. It also shows the attendance we taken at each meetup. In future, you can refer to this sheet to check if your attendance is taken! (not necessary imo) 

The scores means the following:
-1 means you RSVP-ed but did not show up, 
 0 means you did not register and did not turn up,
1 means you RSVP-ed and turn up! 

if there is any error  or requests such as

1) your name is not unique (thus full join error)
2) you like your name changed
3) or you did turn up but for some reason it marks you as -1

Please let any of us know and we will edit accordingly! 

For the curious: in the spirit of Data Science, we actually used R-shiny and googlesheets as a way of persistent storage to log our attendance so we can easily compute our leaderboard. Saves paper and the environment too!

Attendance taking aims to ensure (i) responsible community members can attend our meetups, (ii) venue space is not wasted on no-shows, (iii) proper estimation and minimal wastage of refreshments catered (like at the AXA meetup yesterday). Wastage is bad and inefficient--whether payment for venue or refreshment is involved is moot.

The attendance board is informational: to allow members to check their attendance record. Members also want their attendance to be acknowledged, and recognised as part of the community (and a regular). We hope it doesn't come across as shaming?though people should be ashamed for RSVPing and not showing up, denying space to other members.

We understand the attendance board is unusual, almost as unusual as our RSVP issues?ah first world problems! While it may take some getting used to,  the aim is to serve the majority of the community. =)

Think of DSSG as an open-source project. Features include meet-ups (on monthly basis with distinguished speakers), Facebook group (with generous sharing of informative articles), etc. Patches are welcome (e.g., venue with central location that doesn't collect emails of attendees). We can?t please all users but we?ll try our best to serve the community with regard to the meet-up feature.

Regarding privacy concerns, the information (user name and attendance) is neither personal, confidential, high-risk, nor illegal?it is provided when you register and RSVP. The attendance board merely aggregates the information and shows who the regulars are.

For others who are against this on the grounds that it is childish/pointless, perhaps you can elaborate more? Please try to consider and balance with the benefits of ensuring most community members can benefit from our speakers sharing.",photo,,,,ï»¿https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153984228058708&set=gm.450468385162357&type=3

We will have a tutorial session on Neo4j at our February meetup!

Here are the details:
Tutorial: Neo4j and Python for Dummies by Eric C.Y. Lee 

Eric will give an introduction to graph database and Neo4j. He will demonstrate how you can install and setup Neo4j. He will explain some simple ""Cypher Query Language"" syntaxes. After you have basic knowledge of Neo4j, Eric will guide you through an exercise.

If you would like to follow along, bring along a laptop, preferably with Linux or Mac OSX and the latest copy of Neo4j 2.3 at http://neo4j.com/download. The community version is fine, although the Enterprise version is better.

This video featured on Microsoft's Channel 9 shows how one can perform interactive log analysis and data visualization with Jupyter notebook and PySpark (Python Spark) on a Apache Spark cluster (Linux) on the Azure HDInsight.

The same tools are applicable for other big data scenario on other big data cloud platform.  

Key takeaways:
- Basics of Apache Spark, RDD, HDInsight
- Basics of Jupyter Notebook, PySpark libraries
- Custom Python library for easy and efficient IIS log parsing
- Sample Code on GitHub

- For members who RSVP and no-show, they will receive -1 point. (RSVPs close 48 hrs before the event--please cancel your rsvp before this.)
- For members who RSVP and show, they will receive +1 point.
- E.g., Bill RSVPs for 3 meetups. He shows up for only 1. Thus, he gets (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1 point.
- Members who have < -3 points will be banned.
- Members who have > 10 points will get VIP and can attend meetups without RSVP for a year.
- Please approach our committee members to take your attendance. Thank you!",photo,,,,ï»¿https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153903758078708&set=gm.438719556337240&type=3

What if you want to create a machine learning model but realized that your input dataset doesn?t fit your computer memory? Usual you would use distributed computing tools like Hadoop and Apache Spark for that computation in a cluster with many machines. However, Apache Spark is able to process your data in local machine standalone mode and even build models when the input data set is larger than the amount of memory your computer has. In this blog post, I?ll show you an end-to-end scenario with Apache Spark where we will be creating a binary classification model using a 34.6 gigabytes of input dataset. Run this scenario in your laptop (yes, yours with its 4-8 gigabytes of memory and 50+ gigabytes of disk space) to test this.

The group can be shut down if we have posts that violate Facebook's community standards rules.

If you see anything that is clearly spam or depicts nudity, please alert the admin with immediate effect. We seek your help to grow this community and keep it alive.

Thank you for your continued support and I look forward to seeing you on 21 Oct. do remember to register",photo,Robert,"Hi all,

We are having an influx of spam posts, promoting nudity/porn/sexual services/etc, taking advantage of our open nature of accepting anyone (or possibly, bots) into the group. Most of the time, the admin team here catch on pretty fast. Sometimes, members will report the posts the were not caught fast to the admins. Just recently, there's even one that got reported to Facebook itself. It is possible to have Facebook to unilaterally shutdown the entire group itself.

To mitigate possible negative action taken by Facebook (i.e. closing this group down. It had happened before to a 10k+ members group that I was in), all future posts are to be approved by any of the admins. Given the number of admins we have in the group, it will be fast to approve the posts. For those who worry about censorship/shadow-banning/etc, I cannot think of a better solution to keep this group up, please contribute your ideas.

Thanks.

We will monitor the situation and determine if a curated approach or a minimal intervention approach will better suit our community.

Thoughts?",photo,A Mighty Girl,"25-year-old Emily Kennedy was in middle school when she first learned the horrible truths about human trafficking from a church youth leader who had worked in a red light district in Cambodia: ?I was really inspired by how he spent his time to pull girls out of the sex trade and provide rehabilitation."" Years later as an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University, she focused her senior thesis on how data mining the ""deep Web"" could be used to identify traffickers and help victims. Today, Kennedy is the founder and CEO of Marinus Analytics, a Pittsburgh technology start-up whose Traffic Jam software has already aided in the rescue of 120 victims of human trafficking in the US. 

The artificial intelligence-powered software program works by looking for patterns in publicly accessible information such as cell phone numbers and e-mail addresses in the advertisements that sex traffickers use to promote their services. Connections can lead to individuals who are involved in trafficking, both the ringleaders of trafficking rings and the victims who are being exploited. As Kennedy explains, ""What prompted me to start this project was learning that while technology has empowered criminals to more efficiently exploit their victims, law enforcement doesn't have the time or the ability to develop the technology to respond.""

Kennedy first began work on Traffic Jam as a research analyst at the Auton Lab in CMU?s School of Computer Science, which has received grant support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to study how data mining can be used to help track sex traffickers. Last year, she was able to make Marinus a stand-alone venture, which led to ?the biggest influx of funding we?ve received?: a $200,000 runner-up prize in July?s inaugural UpPrize competition, which recognizes technology companies with a strong social mission.

So far, multiple law enforcement agencies across the US have made use of Traffic Jam, including the FBI's Pittsburgh office where special agent Gregory Heeb said that software has ""helped us to find a number of subjects and locate minors that were involved online."" In the long-term, Kennedy also sees applications for Traffic Jam beyond sex trafficking into other areas where significant criminal activity occurs online such as drug smuggling, money laundering, and monitoring terrorist/hate group activity. 

Most importantly, Traffic Jam has potential to stop these crimes at the root: by catching the people who organize them. In speaking about their efforts to end sex trafficking, Kennedy says, ?The goal and mission of our project is to shine a light on those hiding in the shadows so that law enforcement can get the people who are behind these crimes, not just rescue the victims who are out in the open.?

Generally, I need to classify some medical documents according to ICD-10 codes. Problem is that the codes follow a hierarchy, so features that discriminates at higher levels of the hierarchy may not be useful at lower levels.

For example, ""diabetes mellitus"" may be useful to ICD-10 block E08-E13, but won't be useful to point specifically to ""Type 1 diabetes mellitus"" (ICD-10 code E10). The problem is worse for ICD-10 chapter C00-D49 for cancer, since ""malignant neoplasm"" appears in majority of the labels in the chapter. However, the chapter is pretty high in the hierarchy (lots of ICD-10 codes falls under it).

Say I have a test-set with no response variable and riddled with NAs for numerical variables.

Some of these numerical variables turn up high in the variance importance, but have around 5% of entries being NA.

What is the normal approach to filling these NAs so that random forests can actually churn out a prediction for the rows with these NAs?

Stuff I have tried: na.roughfix, aka filling NAs with column medians, probably not a good idea since its too simplistic.

rfImpute, using one of the predictors as response. since rfImpute requires a response variable to do its magic. Due to the fact that I have a predictor having no NA and this predictor and the predictor I am trying to fill having strong relationships.

for example,
Gender noOfShoes
M 4
M 6
F 24
F 40
F NA

Say I am trying to predict income level of Individuals. the NA in row 5 is bothering me as when I do predictions, due to the nature of RF the prediction for row 5 will be NA. Should I do rfImpute with response variable being gender and the dataset to be filled to be noOfShoes?

Have a hunch what I'm doing is very wrong....

In the middle of the summer the hottest topic is getting away from the city hectic for a short break. There is no better time than this to invite Skyscanner to join us for a great meetup dedicated to meta-search engines for travel and more specifically for flights!

Topic: Data Science Challenges in Travel
Speakers: 
Konstantin Halachev, PhD - Skyscanner: https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantinhalachev
Plamen Aleksandrov - Skyscanner: https://www.linkedin.com/in/plamenalexandrov

Konstantin Halachev graduated the Sofia University, before moving to the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Germany to do a PhD in bioinformatics. He then briefly worked on personalization in e-commerce, before accepting the challenge to play with Skyscanner?s data in their newest office in Sofia.

Plamen Aleksandrov also graduated from Sofia University, and specialised in Meta-search Heuristics for Discrete Optimization in JKU Linz, Austria. He later worked on a flight search engine and discovered the nitty-gritty specifics and complexities of the Airline Distribution Industry, before joining Skyscanner in Sofia.

Time: Wednesday, July 29, 19:00
Registration starts at 18:30
Venue: betahaus

Summary:
Have you ever searched for a flight online? Do you wonder when and where you can get the best price for your travel plans? And, why are there different flight prices? Now, do you want to hear about why it is hard to do a meta-search engine for travel, and especially for flights?

About Skyscanner:
Skyscanner is a leading travel search site offering unbiased, comprehensive and free flight, hotel and car hire search services, used by over 40 million unique visitors every month.

We will end the panel promptly at 7.45pm and carry on chatting over craft beers =). Given that spaces are limited, please only RSVP if you're able to arrive punctually (you can drop by after 7.45 without RSVP-ing). Thank you!

What I'm trying to do is to web scrap sites (done) and extract keywords from the articles within the sites (done) and derive deep context of the keywords from the scrapped articles.

The simplest example I can reference is Siri where speech is converted to text and natural language processing is used to get context of your question and process it with search.

In my case, I'm using it for future cross-comparison of user behaviour for content recommendation. So there's actually two concerns that I have: How to do it smartly & anything that should be taken note of.

My fellow ASEAN Power Shift delegates and I are hosting a ""data sprint"" event tomorrow afternoon. We will be analysing data that came through from a 1-month online survey of what Singapore youths think on climate change, and what they want to see now and in the next 20 years. We received responses too from Singapore residents who are not exactly youth but want to have their say also. These data will be used to formulate a concise national position paper which we want to submit to the competent authorities in the local government.",event,Let's sprint into data - What Singapore youths think of climate change,"[What this event is about]
ASEAN Power Shift's Singapore delegate team is conducting an online survey to canvas for perceptions and thoughts of Singapore youths on climate change, and what is being done to address it. 

The survey: http://bit.do/APS15_SGYouthVoice

The responses are key to formulating a national position paper, which will be submitted to the relevant authorities in the local government.

In a ASEAN Power Shift conference later this month, we will be aligning the position paper with that of other countries in the region to form a regional position paper. This regional position paper will be submitted to the ASEAN Secretariat and also to the President of global UN climate negotiations to be held at Paris in Dec 2015.

The survey closes on 21 Jul, but we also intend to complete most of our data analysis by then, in order to formulate the position paper, in time for the ASEAN Power Shift conference from 24th Jul. 

As the survey has a number of open-ended questions, we foresee that it will take us some time to dig through the questions and gain insights from the data.

Hence, we decided to see if there are any data scientists out there willing to give us a hand in coming up with good insights together :)

The team has done some initial analysis, and will share what we have analysed to date. We will also share the data for use in the event, with data anonymised before-hand, to ensure confidentiality.

[When]

[Where]

My fellow ASEAN Power Shift delegates and I are hosting a ""data sprint"" event tomorrow (18 Jul) afternoon. We will be analysing data that came through from a 1-month online survey of what Singapore youths think on climate change, and what they want to see now and in the next 20 years. We received responses too from Singapore residents who are not exactly youth but want to have their say also. These data will be used to formulate a concise national position paper which we want to submit to the competent authorities in the local government.",event,Let's sprint into data - What Singapore youths think of climate change,"[What this event is about]
ASEAN Power Shift's Singapore delegate team is conducting an online survey to canvas for perceptions and thoughts of Singapore youths on climate change, and what is being done to address it. 

The survey: http://bit.do/APS15_SGYouthVoice

The responses are key to formulating a national position paper, which will be submitted to the relevant authorities in the local government.

In a ASEAN Power Shift conference later this month, we will be aligning the position paper with that of other countries in the region to form a regional position paper. This regional position paper will be submitted to the ASEAN Secretariat and also to the President of global UN climate negotiations to be held at Paris in Dec 2015.

The survey closes on 21 Jul, but we also intend to complete most of our data analysis by then, in order to formulate the position paper, in time for the ASEAN Power Shift conference from 24th Jul. 

As the survey has a number of open-ended questions, we foresee that it will take us some time to dig through the questions and gain insights from the data.

Hence, we decided to see if there are any data scientists out there willing to give us a hand in coming up with good insights together :)

The team has done some initial analysis, and will share what we have analysed to date. We will also share the data for use in the event, with data anonymised before-hand, to ensure confidentiality.

[When]

I would like to pick up your thoughts on the following - As you probably know, SAS has the SAS BIA program (funded by IDA and non-funded one). 

Especially for the non-funded one - where the student would follow the exact same thing as the funded by IDA version. 

Assuming the overall aim is to start a career in analytics (rather than DS) in established large corporate or to some extent, big SMEs (probably cutting out start-ups) 

And all the training will be related to SAS and delivered by SAS itself: SAS programming, SAS SQL, SAS Macro, SAS Enterprise Miner, etc (http://www.bmi-asia.com/sas_form/Program_outline.html) 

> Do you believe it would be wise to go through the programme, and why?
> Looking ahead to the next 10 years - (SAS has been around for 40 years now, considering they have seen it all, almost) - would the expertise in SAS still be relevant? (SAS will upgrade & adapt with time too, I suppose)
> As more companies pop-up and tackling various verticals, would it make sense to be over-reliant on SAS (and its software suites)? 

My main concern is probably the interchangeability of hard skills acquired using SAS over a few years....",link,SAS-BIA PROGRAM,,ï»¿bmi-asia.com,ï»¿http://www.bmi-asia.com/sas_form/Program_outline.html

I hope that some of you guys have ideas that can help me solve this tough problem. I want to dive into DNA sequence analysis, specifically as to how I can identify matching ancestral segments in raw DNA data files from the three main DTC's (23andme, FTDNA and AncestryDNA).

A bit background, the data files per tested customer have between 577-708k SNP (basically mutations or copying errors) in it. That's a lot of columns of data for very little rows in comparison (currently about 2.5 million autosomal tests have been processed - customer can do test at more than one company).

Industry wide the current minimum criteria is to have 700 of those SNP's matching with someone else (on the same chromosome and overlapping segment). Segments that we inherit from our parents are very rarely a complete 1:1 copy of one parent's chromosome, usually there are between 1-3 crossover (meaning the chromosome is constructed from alternating pairs of segments from our parents chromosome, just the reverse or for the other copy of the same chromosome). It's not clear where these crossover happen unless you can compare your DNA data against one or both parents data (called phasing).

I can explain more details about it but let's come to my main question for this group. How can I identify in the fastest (meaning with the minimum amount of comparisons) way where exactly two persons DNA is matching on an overlapping segment on a given chromosome?

If you imagine that you start with just 1000 samples the comparison can for sure be done gene-by-gene (brute force) but every new sample has to be compared against all other samples for all of the 46 chromosome pairs (23 x 2) and the above total amount of genes between 600-700k. That very soon gets into an enormous job.

Now given that I think you guys have a very broad knowledge of different statistical approaches and use cases, what are your ideas to tackle such a problem in a smarter way (than brute force)?

Surely if the whole algorithm is running on Amazon's cloud the scalability is basically only limited by the amount of money you want to throw at it but given that I'm not Bill Gates or some other rich dude I need a more practical idea to limit the computation time (and memory, not so much disc space I think).

I have something that I'll like to pique your interest - there's an amazing event going on at the end of May which I'm organising on behalf of Singapore Management University. 

We will be bringing to you a Block Chain 2.0 seminar, with the developers of Ethereum and their project partner, DigixGlobal, who will be sharing their experience of working on Ethereum's technology. 

The Ethereum developers themselves will be introducing their Block Chain 2.0 technology and share with you guys how to create, design and own your Block Chain. Furthermore, we have guest speakers, cryptocurrency consultants, who will speak on how Decentralized Economies and businesses can be. 

This can greatly benefit you should you wish to reach out and connect with fellow professionals in the data science scene, bitcoin and analytics professionals and share ideas on how you can benefit the Financial Tech industry. 

Best of all, this event is absolutely free, so, check out our event page at http://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore/ and RSVP there! See you then!",photo,,,,ï»¿https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153291968132037&set=gm.364551713754025&type=3

Army nurses also had other ideas. After the war, realizing this ""data trend"", the small company reinvented itself as a Sanitary pad Giant... :p

""A material called Cellucotton had already been invented before war broke out, by what was then a small US firm - Kimberly-Clark. The company's head of research, Ernst Mahler, and its vice-president, James, C Kimberly, had toured pulp and paper plants in Germany, Austria and Scandinavia in 1914 and spotted a material five times more absorbent than cotton and - when mass-produced - half as expensive.

They took it back to the US and trademarked it. Then, once the US entered the war in 1917, they started producing the wadding for surgical dressing at a rate of 380-500ft per minute.

But Red Cross nurses on the battlefield realised its benefits for their own personal, hygienic use, and it was this unofficial use that ultimately made the company's fortune.

""The end of the war in 1918 brought about a temporary suspension of K-C's wadding business because its principal customers - the army and the Red Cross - no longer had a need for the product,"" the company says today.

So it re-purchased the surplus from the military and created a new market.

""After two years of intensive study, experimentation and market testing, the K-C team created a sanitary napkin made from Cellucotton and fine gauze, and in 1920, in a little wooden shed in Neenah, Wisconsin, female employees began turning out the product by hand,"" the company says.

The new product, called Kotex (short for ""cotton texture""), was sold to the public in October 1920, less than two years after the Armistice.""",link,ichef.bbci.co.uk,,ï»¿ichef.bbci.co.uk,ï»¿http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/304/media/images/74245000/jpg/_74245696_kotex-ad.jpg

I'm organizing a group of 4 friends to do a self-driven independent data science bootcamp. We'll work on a selection of online courses (datasciencemasters.org) and a Kaggle competition. We're looking to hire tutors!

* What * 
- $$$ We'll pay you a very good rate per hour (negotiable, PM me) 
- When our group meets, you would have ""open office hours"" for M (about 3-6) hours at a time for N (about 1-4) days per week (depending on your schedule and preferences for M and N) 

* Why * 
- We're fun, self-motivated people who want to use data science skills to do awesome projects. And we will buy you ice cream. 
- Teaching data science will help you to understand it better

>> PM me with the reasons that you're qualified to teach, when you're available, and any other preferences for how you'd like to teach.

Cuifen will be providing an introduction to the online ArcGIS tool-- a free online alternative to the ArcGIS tool commonly used in mapping--as well as providing some examples of the work it can create. While mapping is often seen as a researcher?s tool, it is also a great way of expressing the work you?ve done, the places you?ve been visually?for your personal website or for a campaign. Check out what she?s done so far (http://tiny.cc/ylitwx) for @[446371078860565:274:Crop Things], a citizen-led initiative that aims to map edible gardens and ?grow-spots? in Singapore. This session will also include a short sharing on another available software, Google Maps, and quick tricks to simplify mapping and data collection with Google Drive.

Cuifen is a visual story-teller who creates maps and illustrations to help decision makers and the general public visualise the natural environment, and our interactions with it. Having initiated her edible community garden in her neighbourhood, she is always looking to learn more, collaborate more, and share more. As a long-time user of ArcGIS, she has recently begun experimenting with the online software to create online maps. She welcomes an active interchange of ideas with the audience, be it about mapping, other mapping tools and gardens!",ï»¿Making Maps: Visual Storytelling with ArcGIS and Google Maps,ï»¿https://www.facebook.com/events/838303122901747/

Post-trip data can then be pulled back into the cloud to further optimize future trips.

May I ask if anyone took / is taking / plans to take a Specialist Diploma in Statistics and Data Mining in Singapore Poly? or other similar courses in Singapore?

I'm thinking of the quality of the course at the SP as compared to those that we have on Coursera..
Thanks and pls comment to this post (or PM me) if you know anything about the course or if you know of anyone who took the course before. 
Many thanks! :)",status,,,,

Gartner and Mckinsey estimate the skill deficit to the tune of 1.5 million- 4.4 million plus. To top it all, Data scientist is rated as the sexiest job of 21st century.
Am sure this has led to most of you to be really interested in continuing your career in analytics and Big data. To address the opportunity, and current issues, we have come-up with a learning platform which will help users to learn business Analytics through real industry scenarios modeled as simulations. Currently our platform is used by a few fortune-500 clients, but we are just making it open for all.

To test this platform we need some individuals who are willing to spare some time(close to an hour) on testing the product and give us feedback from usability point.The volunteers will be getting goodies and coupons.
We would appreciate it, if you can help us make learning better through your feedback.

The good performers in this platform will be given an opportunity to connect with data science hiring officials.

1. Respect 
2. Relevance
3. Repeat

This  community is still in its infancy and in order for the group to thrive, some scaffolds need to be put in place and weeds need to be removed from time to time.

A short list of guidelines have been put up to hopefully nurture and grow the community. 

1. Respect
Always respect other members in the community
Vulgarities and belittling is not tolerated
We do not like bullies
2. Relevance
The posts should be relevant and cover topics related to datascience from an infrastructural, mathematical and philosophical standpoint
There is enough spam in our inbox and we wish to maintain a clean environment where members can share and learn and level up together
3. Repeat
Repeat point 1 and point 2",status,,,,

Here are my slides from the presentation this week. It was nice that so many of you made it to the event and stayed to chat afterwards. Please connect with me on LinkedIn if you haven't already -- we're all friends here!

Thanks to the organisers of the DataScienceSG group for kindly inviting me to participate. 

Here is a brief write-up of the position I'm trying to fill on my team at TripAdvisor. If you're interested you can write to me directly with your CV at njachowski [at] gmail.com.
---------------------------------------
I'm looking for what I would call a ""Dual Stack"" data scientist. The person should have the full gamut of technical experience ranging from being able to set-up and manage linux servers, to developing databases, to writing scalable production code. Must have strong scripting and general data-related hacking skills. The languages we tend to use include SQL, Python, R and a lot of Bash, but anything goes as long as it gets the job done.

The other side of the ""Dual Stack"" is the business (non-technical) side. We are a part of the global sales team so the role would involve significant interaction with internal and external clients involving 10-20% travel both regionally and globally. 

My team is like a small start-up within the bigger organisation. We hack on top of the vast data sources at TripAdvisor to develop high impact products for the CPC (cost per click) Hotel Auction. It's very fast moving and business orientated. The type of person most likely to succeed in the role would probably have at least a master's degree in a computationally heavy field, deep technical start-up experience in addition to very good teamwork, people and sales skills.

The position would be based in Singapore and would work directly with me. We would be the technical core, with the rest of the team consisting of three MBAs based in Germany, UK and US.

The Lunatics Are Running the Asylum

I keep hearing Data Scientists say that 'statistics is dead', but why is this?
Do they know what they're talking about or are they just running scared?

In my first (and very popular!) guest blog I took a look at what's going on in the battle of the beasts, and I reckon the lunatics have taken over.

For example, in the case of a Neural Network, we can think about optimizing the number of hidden units, the learning rate, or the regularization weight. In order to tune these, you need to train and test several different combinations of hyperparameters and pick the best one for your final model. 

A naive approach is to simply perform an exhaustive grid search over the different possible combinations of reasonable hyperparameters. However, when faced with a complex model where training each one is time consuming and there are many hyperparameters to tune, it can be prohibitively costly to perform such exhaustive grid searches. Luckily, you can do better than this by thinking of parameter tuning as an optimization problem in itself.""",link,The Netflix Tech Blog: Distributed Neural Networks with GPUs in the AWS Cloud,,ï»¿techblog.netflix.com,ï»¿http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/02/distributed-neural-networks-with-gpus.html

I'm not really a data scientist or anything but would appreciate if the brilliant people here could help! I am currently working on building a simple copula model(multivariate) of a joint probability distribution. 

Why I'm doing this is because I can observe marginal distributions but not joint distributions. But what I am interested in is the joint probability.

Problem is, I don't know which copula to use! I have done my research and googled for some ways of determining a proper copula model form (Gaussian, t student, frank, etc) however, it seems that what people are suggesting is to find Kendall's tau/ spearman rho correlations to choose a proper model. 

However, I am not really a mathematician or anything so I'm wondering whether this is the right approach. For anyone who has much experience in copula modeling, help is very much appreciated :).",status,,,,

Synopsis
As the global energy demand is increasing, the share of renewable energy and specifically wind energy in the supply is growing. While vast literature exists on the design and operation of wind turbines, there exists a gap in the literature with regards to the investigation and analysis of wind turbine accidents. The richest publicly available source of information on wind turbines are the news articles that appear in wind industry periodicals and Internet websites. Yet, this information has not yet been harvested and analysed for the benefit of human safety and the wind energy and related industries. 

This paper describes the application of text mining and machine learning techniques for discovering actionable insights and knowledge from news articles on wind turbine accidents. The applied analysis methods are text processing, clustering, multidimensional scaling (MDS), ranking, and linear projection. These methods have been combined under a single analysis framework, and new insights have been discovered for the domain. The results of our research can be used by wind turbine manufacturers, engineering companies, insurance companies, and government institutions to address problem areas and enhance systems and processes. 

This talk will cover the concept, latest technologies and potential applications of text mining to automate the knowledge discovery process on the unstructured business and operation data.

Description:

At Viki we collect and analyze over 60M user-generated data points everyday. This talk goes into deep technical and architecture design to share about the infrastructure, the different tools and process we?ve built with our analytics system. Specifically we?ll talk about how we collect data, how we process data and how we present data in both real-time and batch manners.

The current system is capable of supporting a variety of business and product needs: automated business reporting, a/b testing, cohort analysis, funnel analysis, recommendation engine, etc.

Technology stack: Ruby, Python, R, NodeJS, Golang, PostgreSQL, Java, Storm, Hadoop with Apache Hive.

We are also looking for summer interns - http://bit.ly/viki-summer-internship .

We will talk more about our summer internship offers for students, what a typical intern?s life looks like and what works our past interns have done at the end of the talk.

Speakers:

Jason Grendus is Director of Analytics at Viki (a Rakuten company), a global TV site that streams TV shows, movies and other premium content. Jason has many years of experience developing database solutions to solve business and financial analysis problems, with a depth of experience in many database and data warehouse technologies. In his current role, Jason?s primary focus is the scalability of Viki?s analytics and reporting systems. Jason made his first foray into large-scale analytics / big data as the first analytics engineer hired at Slide (acquired by Google for $200m), where his role evolved to encompass load balancing the data pipeline for 1TB of logging data per day across a distributed network of servers.

If this is a topic that interests you, then do come along!

Details here: https://www.facebook.com/events/308962392588955/",event,Clojure Data Dojo,"This the inaugural Clojure Data Dojo in Singapore.

The aim will be to introduce and use a new data science tool at each Dojo. A speaker will briefly present the topic and demonstrate some basic features. Then there will be an opportunity to work in pairs / small groups for 1-2 hours. 

Experienced coders who already know the topic well may choose to become mentors - moving between the groups and helping out / dispensing wisdom as necessary.

At the end of the dojo (around 9pm), we'll stop coding and give each group a chance to present back for 2-3 minutes, showing what they have done and sharing their experiences.

The first topic will be: ""Functional array programming with core.matrix""

core.matrix is an API / toolkit for handling multi-dimensional data in Clojure - an important tool for processing and manipulating big data sets. It adds language capabilities usually found is esoteric array programming languages like APL to Clojure. For those familiar with Python, it plays a similar role to NumPy / SciPy, but with more of a ""functional programming"" twist.

We'll focus on using core.matrix in a functional programming style to create data transformation pipelines. Essential techniques for any Clojurist / Data Scientist!",ï»¿Clojure Data Dojo,ï»¿https://www.facebook.com/events/308962392588955/

Title:
Media, Community, and the Social Photograph 

Abstract:
A decade ago we saw the birth of Flickr, a media website for social photo sharing. Since then, social media websites have grown to encompass many types of photo, video, audio, and even hyper-link sharing. Many researchers have conducted work on these social-websites in general yet there still exists many opportunities to explore how people engage with media online, specifically multimedia, in social contexts. In this talk, I will highlight some new challenges for researchers studying social photography and present a few recent findings from my lab's investigation of Flickr which include geographic annotation of photographs and regions, community congregation online, and social engagement. 

Bio:
David Ayman Shamma (Yahoo! Research, USA) is a senior research scientist and head of the HCI Research group at Yahoo! Labs and the scientific liaison to Flickr. His personal research investigates synchronous environments and connected experiences both online and in-the-world. Focusing on creative expression and sharing frameworks, he designs and prototypes systems for multimedia-mediated communication, as well as, develops targeted methods and metrics for understanding how people communicate online in small environments and at web scale.

Please join us for his presentation on scalable cross-platform R-based Predictive Analytics.  Event is free and open to all so feel free extend the invitation to other associates who may be keen as well.  Seat is limited to first 80 pax.

Location: Mapletree Business City, 10 Pasir Panjang Road
 
Agenda:
1. Introduction to Revolution R, COA and COE ? 10 mins
2. Introduction to Big Data Analytics with Hadoop ? 25 mins (guest speaker)
3. Scalable Cross-Platform R-Based Predictive Analytics ? 45 mins (Mario)
 
Abstract:
In this talk we will discover how to perform predictive analytics scalably using an R-based tool across a wide range of platforms: Windows and Linux laptops and workstations, multicore servers, Hadoop and MPI clusters, and massively parallel databases. We will take a tour through an end-to-end predictive analytics session, starting by exploring our data with summaries and histograms. Using the knowledge gleaned from data exploration, we will create transformations to clean our data and prepare it for model building. Next, we will establish a prediction baseline by performing linear regression. Then we will apply an advanced iterative algorithm to push prediction to the limit. Finally, we will use this high quality model to score new data, completing the prediction workflow.

Data business people focus on the organization and how data projects yield profit. They were most likely to rate themselves highly as leaders and entrepreneurs.

Data Creatives who can often tackle the entire soupto-nuts analytics process on their own: from extracting data, to integrating and layering it, to performing statistical or other advanced analyses, to creating compelling visualizations and interpretations, to building tools to make the analysis scalable and broadly applicable.

Data Developers focused on the technical problem of managing data ? how to get it, store it, and learn from it.

Just to give you an idea, my current ranked 14/164 solution for this competition below consists of identifying and removing trend breaking data with Kolmogorov?Smirnov test, removing outliers with median absolute deviation and linear ensemble of random forest, support vector machines & generalized boosted regression models on logged, rule based re-classified data. 

It took me 1 month, 37 submissions and 2 years of Kaggle experience to do this. It is not easy. I learnt all these on my own and did countless experiments to fit all these techniques together. But if someone like me who failed junior college maths and almost drop out of school can do it, I am pretty sure anyone can learn these techniques as long as they put in the effort. ^^",link,Description - See Click Predict Fix | Kaggle,"Kaggle is a platform for data prediction competitions.
